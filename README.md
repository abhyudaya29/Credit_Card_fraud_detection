# Credit_Card_fraud_detection

The objective of the Credit Card Fraud Detection project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately identify fraudulent credit card transactions. With the increasing prevalence of online transactions, credit card fraud has become a significant concern for financial institutions and cardholders. Detecting fraudulent transactions promptly is crucial to mitigate financial losses and protect customers.

In this project, we will leverage machine learning algorithms to analyze historical credit card transaction data and identify patterns indicative of fraudulent activity. The project will involve the following steps:

Data Collection: Gathering a dataset containing labeled credit card transaction data, including both genuine and fraudulent transactions. This dataset will serve as the basis for training and evaluating our machine learning model
